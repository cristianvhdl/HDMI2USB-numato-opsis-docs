|     0x5   | Production board.                                  |

### Serial Number

No serial number is provided in *Failsafe Mode* or *Unconfigured Mode*.

In other modes, the serial number should be the MAC Address embedded in the EEPROM.

### Failsafe Mode

If the Cypress FX2 is unable to read any EEPROM on boot it will boot into
[Failsafe Booting](/features/usb-peripheral.html#failsafe-mode---unable-to-read-eeprom).

### Unconfigured Mode

If the FPGA is unable to provide the Cypress FX2 with firmware, the FX2 will
boot in unconfigured mode.
[unconfigured mode](/features/usb-peripheral.html#unconfigured-mode---real-eeprom-booting).
