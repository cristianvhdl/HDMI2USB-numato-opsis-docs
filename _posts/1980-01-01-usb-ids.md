Due to the configurable nature of the [Cypress FX2] the board can appear under
a number of different [USB IDs]. This page tries to collect all the common 
[USB IDs] that the Opsis board can enumerate as.

More information about the USB IDs can be found at the following places;
 * [FIXME: Put a link to the USB spec here](http://FIXME/)
 * [USB in a NutShell: USB Descriptors](http://www.beyondlogic.org/usbnutshell/usb5.shtml#DeviceDescriptors)

## Serial Number

No serial number is provided in *[Failsafe Mode]* or *[Unconfigured Mode]*.

In other modes, the serial number should be the MAC Address embedded in the EEPROM.

# Failsafe Mode

If the [Cypress FX2] is unable to read from any EEPROM on boot it will boot
into [Failsafe Booting].

|   Serial No | None   |
| Chip & Port | [USB Peripheral](/features/usb-peripheral.html), USB-B port on front. |

# Unconfigured Mode

If the FPGA is unable to provide the [Cypress FX2] with firmware, the FX2 will
boot in [unconfigured mode].
